# MyReads Project

This is my modified starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this app is to implement a book management application, meeting requirements from the review rubric here: [Project Specification](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view)


## TL;DR

To use my MyReads app right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
